Assignment 2: Design a database schema for a library system, including tables, fields, and constraints like NOT NULL, UNIQUE, and CHECK. Include primary and foreign keys to establish relationships between tables?

create table books(
Bookid number  primary key,
Title varchar2(20) not null,
ISBN varchar2(20) unique,
Publishedyear number check (Publishedyear > 0)
);
describe books;

create table authors(
Authorid number primary key,
FirstName varchar2(20) not null,
LastName varchar2(20) not null
);
describe authors;

create table reservations(
Reservationid number primary key,
Bookid number not null,
Memberid number not null,
foreign key (Bookid) references books (Bookid)
);
describe reservations;

Explanation:
Primary Key(PK) : Unique identifier for each row in the table, Primary key can have only one in the table
Foreign Key(FK) : Establishes relationships between tables.
Not null : It means that the column cannot have null value.
Unique : It means that all the values in the column are unique.
Check : It means that all the values in a column satisfy a specific condition.
